# Creating Lyaouts and Pages

# Nested Routing

- Next.js uses file-system routing. This approach uses folders to created nested routes. 

- Each folder respresnts a route segment that maps to a URL segment.

- You can create separate UIs for each route using layout.tsx and page.tsx files.

- page.tsx is a special NExt.js file that exports a React component and it is required for the route to be accessible.

- In this example app, the /app/page.tsx is the home page assosciated with the route '/'

- To create a nested route, you can nest folders inside each other and add page.tsx files inside of them.
